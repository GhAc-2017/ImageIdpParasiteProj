    <li>A suitable superficial lymph node is selected and palpated so that the site is fully
      known.</li>
    <li>The site is then cleaned with alcohol.</li>
    <li>Using a suitable clean needle and an empty clean hypodermic syringe with all air
      expelled from it, the gland is punctured.</li>
    <li>The plunger of the syringe is then drawn back, drawing some of the fluid from the lymph
      node into the syringe.</li>
    <li>The needle is withdrawn from the site, still attached to the syringe.</li>
    <li>Lymph &quot;juice&quot; is ejected onto a clean microscope slide.</li>
    <li>Smear are then made following the procedure for making a blood smear using a spreader
      slide.</li>
