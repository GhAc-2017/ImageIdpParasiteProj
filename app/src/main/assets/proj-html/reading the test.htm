&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
motility of the trichomonad is well maintained in the lower cocentrations of antibodies
and the organisms may contact one another frequently, become loosely attached and easily
break free again. The normal morphology is preserved as the agglutinin concentration
increases, the protozoa become more firmly adherent. On contact, a few break free larger
clumps are formed, in which the motility is sufficient to rotate the agglutinated masses
forming them into rounded clumps.</p>

indicative of the presence of infection. It should always be confirmed by demonstrating
