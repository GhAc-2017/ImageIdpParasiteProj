<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of Eosin stain</p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font COLOR="#000080">Eosin stain (0.5 percent aqueous solution of
eosin) is sometimes used during the microscopic examination of fresh faeces since this
stain colours the faecal debris into intense red; but freshly passed protozoa, including
cysts, resist the stain. They are easily identified under the low power (16 mm) objective
when they are seen as &quot;pearly&quot; white bodies against a pink background.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes a direct smear is made of faeces, the following methods
    usually being employed. </p>

    <li>A few drops of eosin stain are placed on a clean slide.</li>
    <li>A small amount of faeces is emulsified on the slide with the eosin stain.</li>
    <li>All large particles of faecal material are removed.</li>
    <li>A cover slip is placed on the smear.</li>
    <li>The preparation is examined under a microscope using the low power (16mm) objective.</li>
