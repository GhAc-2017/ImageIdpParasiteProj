<P>       </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Cultures of coccidia for experimantal purposes are propagated in lightly infected experimental animals reared coccidia-free in isolation. The resulting oocysts are collected either from the faeces or from the infected tissue after sacrifice of the host animal at the peak of oocyst production.</P>

<P>       Prepatent periods vary from 4 days for some species in poultry to as long as 24 days for certain species in sheep. Generally, daily faecal oocyst counts will establish the time of peak oocyst discharge.</P>

<P>       The infected animals must be strictly isolated and the cadges, feeding equiptment and laboratory apparatus should be sterilised.</P>

<P>       Technical details vary according to the life cycle of the different species, but in all cases great care must be taken to avoid contamination of the pure culture with additional species.</P>

<P>       The technique for culturing oocysts of <I>Eimeria telella</I> is given as an example bellow :-</P>

<LI>15-20 four week old chicks are inoculated with 500 sporulated oocysts of <I>Eimeria tenella</I>; 1 ml of a  standard suspension is injected directly into the crop by means of a ball-ended canula attached to a syringe. The birds are maintained in sterilised cages, isolated from all other chicks.</LI>

<LI>On the sixth day after infection the dropping trays are lined with polythene sheet and flooded with 2% potassium dichromate solution.</LI>
<I>
<LI> </I>On the seventh day after infection, wash the faeces through 100 mesh (aperture 0.15 mm) and 300 mesh (aperture 0.053 mm) screens, collecting the fluid in a bowl.</LI>

<LI>Transfer the fluid  to a large graduated beaker and record the volume. At this stage it is useful to estimate the total number of oocysts present as follows :</LI>

<LI>Suspend evenly and remove three 1 ml samples to test tubes. Make each of these up to 5 ml (1/5 dil.) with water from each sample count two haemacytometer chambers (fuchs-Rosenthal), covering 5 mm<SUP>2</SUP> in each.</LI>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Calculation : </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>(x/30)*(5/1)*5*1000*y = total number of oocysts.</P>
<P>Where&#9;x= total oocysts counted in 6 chambers.</P>
<P>&#9;30= 6 chambers each of 5mm<SUP>2</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;(5/1) = depth of chamber is 1/5mm. Multiplying by 5 converts to mm<SUP>3</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;5 =  dilution of sample</P>
<P>&#9;1000 = conversion of mm<SUP>3 </SUP>to cm<SUP>3</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;y = total volume in beaker.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI>Spin down in centrifuge bottles at 1000 g for 5 minutes. Pour off suspernatant.</LI>

<LI>Resuspend the sediment in saturated salt solution (NaCl) S.G. 1.2 and float  uyp the oocysts in 100 ml centrifuge tubes at 250 g for 5 minutes.</LI>

<LI>‘Flip off’ the scum from each tubeinto a liter beaker. This contains the oocysts which have floated up. (keep the rest of the supernatant and the sediment in case only a small proportion of the oocysts has recovered.)</LI>

<LI>Dilute the salt about 1/10 with water and spin down at 1000 g for 5 minutes in centrifuge bottles.</LI>

<LI>Pour off the supernatant carefully. Make the sediment up to 150ml with 2% potassium dichromate solution.</LI>

<LI>Prepare three 1 in 10 dilution with water, and from each sample couunt two haemacytometer chambers. Calculation as before.</LI>

<LI>If necessary, dilute to a concentration of 5*10<SUP>5</SUP> oocysts per ml and put to sporulate at 27<SUP>0</SUP>C in 180 mm diameter penicillin flasks – 150 ml in each flask. The amount of oxegen available is an important factor in the sporulation process, and it is essential to have as little detritus as possible. The layer of suspension should not be more than 6 mm deep. Sporulation is generally complete after 2 or 3  days in an incubator at 27<SUP>0</SUP>C. an alternate method when oocysts are particularly ni=umerous or there is heavy detritus, is to use aeration in a measuring cylinder by means of an aquarium pump. The cylinder should be plugged to avoid contamination from aerosole.</LI></OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Standerdisation of the culture</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>:</P>

<P>&#9;Oocysts should be examined daily under the 40x objective of the microscope for the presence of sporozoites within the sporocyst until sporulation appears to be complete, i.e. the  number of mature oocysts reaches a maximum. The concentration of oocysts in the culture may be estimated as before using haemocytometers.</P>

<P>&#9;The proportion of completely sporulated oocysts is assessed as a percentage. This factor is then applied to the total number of oocysts counted and the number of sporulated oocysts per ml calculated.</P>

<P>&#9;Cultures are stored in a refrigerator at 4-5<SUP>0</SUP>C and wioll remain viable for a considerable time, but for critical experimental purpose they should never be more than 4 weeks old, as there is some evidence of a decline in virulence as the culture ages.&#9;</P>
