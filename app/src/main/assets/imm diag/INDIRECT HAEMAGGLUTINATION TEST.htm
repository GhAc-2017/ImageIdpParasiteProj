</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">The agglutination of a particulate antigen by its specific antibody is, classically, the sinplest way of estimating the quantity of antibody in a serum. Red blood cells have been found to be extremly convenient passive carriers of antigen. Coated cells become most sensitive and stable reagent for antibody detection. Some antigens particularly the polysaccharides can be effectively coated by only exposing red cells for a short time. Among the general methods available for coating antigen on red blood cells the most widely used method is the tanned cell technique. Treatment of the red blood cells with tannic acid increases the amount of most protein antigens subsequently adsorbed. The higher density of coated antigen greatly increases the sensitivity of the agglutination reaction. The test can also be used in a reverse manner where tanned red blood cells can also be coated with antibody t test the presence of antigen.</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">In antisera with very high agglutination titres, a prozone phenomenon may obscure the results. The prozone phenomenon produces falsely negative agglutination reaction at higher concentrations of antibody as a result of poor lattice formation and steric hindrance caused by antibody excess. However, the use of standard serial dilution eliminates this difficulty. Since IgM antibody is about 50 times as efficient as IgG in agglutination, the presence of high amounts of IgM may markedly influenece the test results.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>It is important to remove heterophile agglutinins (antibodies) from test ample and normal rabbit serum to avoid nonspecific agglutination of sheep erythrocytes. If the noncoated cells are agglutinated with the lowest dilution of the sample, further absorption should be made until natural agglutinins have been removed.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If the sheep blood is collecetd asceptically in autoclaved Alsever’s sloution with Aureomycin (5 mg in 100 ml Alsever’s sloution), they can be used for at least 2 weeks. Sheep erythrocytes can also be preserved by formalinization after tanning and coating stage. For doing this 8% of tanned coated SRBC in PBS is mixed with equal volume of 3% neutralized formaldehyde. Formaldehyde should be added drop by drop with gentle agitation. Suspension is mixed well and gently agitated at 37<SUP>0</SUP>C for 18 hours. Cells washed five times and preserved as 10% cell suspension with thiomersal at 4<SUP>0</SUP>C for many weeks. </LI></P></UL>
